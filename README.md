# Bash Commands
This project displays a list of Git Bash commands, along with their uses and explanations. 

This is my second project with GetCoding (my first project working with my coach, Gillian). I use HTML and CSS to create a list of Bash commands, along with explanations of the purpose and how to use each command. The project utilizes numbered lists, bullet lists, various fonts and backgrounds. The project is also dynamic in that the display adjusts with resizing of the window.
